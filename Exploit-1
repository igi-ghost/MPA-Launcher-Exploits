This is kinda crazy exploit but the most working and limited one

<======== EXPLOIT 1 =========>
> If you have 2 harddrives on your system, then just exchange the slots of both the hardrives. For eg. your PC have 2 slots for harddrives and Hard Drive 1 is in Slot 1 and Hard Drive 2 is in Slot 2, then put them out and place Hard Drive 1 in Slot 2 and Hard Drive 2 in Slot 1.
By doing this you will definetely get a free name change in the launcher once you open it.

<======== EXPLOIT 2 =========>
> Changing your processor will give you a free name change.

<======== EXPLOIT 3 =========>
> Changing your hard disk will give you a free name change.

<======== EXPLOIT 4 =========>
> Changing your BIOS will give you a free name change.
